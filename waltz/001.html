                        <p class="item-desc">"Just what is augmented reality?" - one might ask such a question. Last year (2016), a mobile game that explodes worldwide and can be considered as a global phenomenon, Pokemon Go, was launched and by February 2017, has reached
                            650 millions download worldwide. Surely among those 650 million users, there is a portion of people who wondered "What kind of technology would allow such image to be projected to the world through this digital looking glass?",
                            minus the flowery wording, obviously. Living in this Age of Information, one could easily attain the answer to that question: that kind of technology is what augmented reality technology is.</p>

                        <p class="item-desc">but what leads to such discovery?</p>

                        <p class="item-desc">Suppose there is an architect who is observing an empty space that is quite wide for a decent building. Suppose that he is with a friend looking at the same empty space. Next, we have a scenario that the architect wished to share
                            his idea what could be built on that empty space with that friend of him, and for that to happen, there is a multitude of ways. the architect could sketch something on a paper actualizing his idea, or with our current technology
                            in mind, he could pull out his smartphone to take a photo of the space and draw on it. but, would it be convenient if we can project the image of those ideas directly to the real space in real time...?</p>

                        <p class="item-desc">probably, that might be the question that inspires the idea of augmented reality or probably not. but the idea surely did not come as a standalone idea, as any other idea has ever been. Ivan Sutherland's essay "The Ultimate Display"
                            in 1965 has kickstarted the idea of possibilities of many kinds of display and human-computer interaction and the concept of augmented reality is one of its fruition. In 1970, Myron Krueger's VIDEOPLACE was the first machine
                            to allow humans interact with virtual objects as it utilizes projectors, video cameras, and special-purpose hardware to produce on-screen silhouettes that can interact with objects from the program. What follows is Louis Rosenberg's
                            Virtual Fixtures, developed in 1992, demonstrating that augmented reality is beneficial in its purpose to remotely control machinery. Recently, from 2015 to 2016, augmented reality, along with virtual reality investment has
                            reached from $700 million to $2.3 billion for their development. As it develops further, proving to be a useful tool in a wide range of purposes, from entertainment to public services, augmented reality is now one of the leading
                            technology industry that still has a lot of potentials.</p>

                        <p class="item-desc">To properly define augmented reality, at least to define exactly what is being discussed in this article. Augmented reality is a view of the real-world physical environment whose elements are augmented by computer-generated sensory
                            input such as audio, video, graphics, or GPS data. The technology involved conventionally generates the view in real-time so the augmentation on the view is presented in a consistent manner that it could become part of the
                            environment.
                        </p>

                        <p class="item-desc">The concept of augmented reality has already been realized in a wide range of application.</p>

                        <p class="item-desc">firstly mentioned, augmented reality in gaming industry popularity has been skyrocketed thanks to Pokemon Go, even though it is not the first one to implement such mechanic. now, this industry sector is one of the few that really
                            embraces the augmented reality concept.</p>

                        <p class="item-desc">Secondly, augmented reality is already implemented in a vast proportion </p>
