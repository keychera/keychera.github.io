                        <p class="item-desc">"Just what is augmented reality?" - one might ask such a question. Last year (2016), a mobile game that explodes worldwide and can be considered as a global phenomenon, Pokemon Go, was launched and by February 2017, has reached
                            650 millions download worldwide. Surely among those 650 million users, there is a portion of people who wondered "What kind of technology would allow such image to be projected to the world through this digital looking glass?"(minus
                            the flowery wording, obviously). Living in this Age of Information, one could easily attain the answer to that question: that kind of technology is what augmented reality technology is.
                        </p>
                        <p class="item-desc">but what leads to such discovery?
                        </p>
                        <p class="item-desc">Suppose there is an architect who is observing an empty space that is quite wide for a decent building. Suppose that he is there with a friend looking at the same empty space. Next, we have a scenario that the architect wished
                            to share his idea of what could be built on that empty space with that friend of him, and for that to happen, there is a multitude of ways. the architect could sketch something on a paper actualizing his idea, or with our current
                            technology in mind, he could pull out his smartphone to take a photo of the space and draw on it with an app he downloaded for such an occasion. but, would it be convenient if we can project the image of those ideas directly
                            to the real space in real time...?
                        </p>
                        <p class="item-desc">...that might or might not be the question that firstly inspires the idea of augmented reality. but the idea surely did not come as a standalone idea, as any other idea has ever been. Ivan Sutherland's essay "The Ultimate Display"
                            in 1965 has kickstarted the idea of possibilities of many kinds of computer displays and human-computer interaction and the concept of augmented reality is one of its fruition. In 1970, Myron Krueger's VIDEOPLACE was the first
                            machine to allow humans interact with virtual objects as it utilizes projectors, video cameras, and special-purpose hardware to produce on-screen silhouettes that can interact with objects from the program. What follows is
                            Louis Rosenberg's Virtual Fixtures, developed in 1992, demonstrating that augmented reality is beneficial for its purpose to remotely control machinery. Recently, from 2015 to 2016, augmented reality investment, along with
                            virtual reality, has reached from $700 million to $2.3 billion for their development. As it develops further, proving to be a useful tool in a wide range of purposes, from entertainment, transportation, to military, augmented
                            reality is now one of the leading technology industry that has a ton of potentials.

                        <p class="item-desc">To properly define augmented reality, at least to define exactly what is being discussed in this article. Augmented reality is a view of the real-world physical environment whose elements are augmented by computer-generated sensory
                            input such as audio, video, graphics, or GPS data. The technology involved conventionally generates the view in real-time so the augmentation on the view is presented in a consistent manner that it could become part of the
                            environment.
                        </p>
                        <p class="item-desc">The concept of augmented reality has already been realized in a wide range of application.
                        </p>
                        <p class="item-desc">In the video gaming industry, augmented reality has already been a concept that can be easily embraced since augmented reality can be a tool to bridge immersion in gameplay. Firstly mentioned above, Pokemon Go is one of many examples.
                        </p>
                        <p class="item-desc">In the military, the concept of augmented reality adapted as a tactical visor that projects information about what is seen is a very great tool for increasing soldier's awareness of their surrounding and increasing the transmission's
                            of information between soldiers.
                        </p>
                        <p class="item-desc">in medical fields, Augmented reality has already helped in augmenting the visuals for observing blood flowing in the blood vein or capturing an image of a fetus. the Near-infrared Vein Finder, a technology released since 2005,
                            is the very product born from the concept of augmented reality.

                        <p class="item-desc">we have advanced far, but there is still far more ahead. technology that has provided assistance to the realization of augmented reality is still far from perfect. the problem is not just limited to the technical one, such as privacy
                            concerns for the hardware since an AR system would continuously record surround and process its information.</p>
