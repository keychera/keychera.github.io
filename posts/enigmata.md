One day in my Discord friend group, the following interaction happened:

![enigmata-facts](img/fact-checked-by-enigmata.png)

A screenshot of a news about one of my favorite game, Honkai: Star Rail, winning an award, followed by an image reaction that shows approval that features a character from Honkai: Star Rail universe. Thematic, playful, the usual atmosphere this discord server have that I love.

But somehow, that reaction image stuck with me. It amuses me mildly, but I cannot articulate it well at the time. So I took some time to gather my thoughts, arranging words in a particular order in this article, hoping this little pocket of experience could be conveyed in textual form.

# the meme amusing me confuses me

There are several amusing aspects that I successfully recognized.

The first aspect is how these memes usually are: It is a parody to a popular format. I was familiar with the meme format "this post was made by __ gang", "this post was approved by council of _", etc. There is also the website "Snope" who provides fact checking articles which is also the subject of the parody. This familiarity of these memes is what I think enables them to propagate, to connects and to convey small messages in an entertaining way.

The second aspect is that this is also an ironic humor, a class of comedy which I really enjoy. But to explain how this is an irony, a little knowledge about this "Enigmata" is needed, so bear with me as I want to introduce a bit about the fictional universe of Honkai: Star Rail.

Honkai: Star Rail is a game, which sets in a universe that has this concept of "Paths". This Path is kinda similar to religion in our world, but instead of revering to divine entities, someone who follows a Path will revolve their life around a the word of the Path's name. A follower of the Path of Destruction will bring about destruction around them, the Path of Preservation will uphold the act of preserving and protecting others, and so on. And now, back to the topic at hand—the Path of Enigmata, which is, to put it lightly, a rather confusing one.

Enigmata, the word itelf, is a latin word that means "a puzzling or inexplicable occurrence or situation."[^1]. Canonically, the followers of this Path are shrouded in mystery. But it's not just them themselves that are confusing, They also have the goal to bring confusion upon the world. And one way they achieve that is through falsification of information. By now, you’ve surely spotted the irony—or have you?

The meme format which shows the act of "fact checking" are done by the actors that creates hoax as their way of life. a textbook irony, a staple of humors that made me smile. The word "real" to describe "follower of Enigmata" is also the icing on the cake. It is brilliant.

And that should have been all there is to it...

but let's talk about 2 more aspect on how it amuses me: What I encountered along the way and the timing where all of this occurs.

# the fallacy that I can understand it all

While I was veryfing my understanding about the path of Enigmata, I encountered this particular in-game text:

![fallacy-recognition](img/recognizability-fallacy.png)

This sentence appearing before me feel like a villain has been introduced into my story. It attacked me. I start reflecting a lot of things all of a sudden. I don't even know if it's a real fallacy or not, but I want to talk about how it affected me at the time. But to do that, let me introduce a bit about myself and the state of mind at the time.

I am just a young programmer with a bit of experience in the industry, and as a side, I have also been dilligently learning Japanese for the past 6 years where I have achieved a pretty [decent][2] level, I must say. Even currently, I managed to work in a place where I employ both my programming and Japanese skill. I am *very* confident with my ability to grow. And I feel like I was just getting started. I can still grow even more, I can still experience even more. I feel limitless... and now, do you see where the conflict arise?

I've been grounded at that moment. It should have been the most obvious thing but it felt to me like a grand discovery. What the fallacy stated actually doesn't directly contradict the confidence that I have, but that fallacy being true means that I will encounter a limit of my growth simply because there are limits to what I can experience and recognize. So then, what happens to my confidence?

That is actually still an ongoing process. If I have reached to a nice resolution in this internal battle someday, I probably will write another article. But for now, the point that amuses me here is that this enabled me to realize that, clearly, I still don't know myself enough. It is a fallacy that all things can be experienced or recognized, and by extension, it is also fallacy that you can recognize all things about oneself.

I am amused by my own self.

# serendipity

Another thing that amuses me is the timing where all of this occurs. It just feels like what happened to me recently in the past week has been all thematic with Enigmata as the anchor. What follows here will be several things that probably feels like a stretch to be in the conversation, but to me at the moment, it feels like an illusion of a beatiful continuation. Each things that I will throw here probably need a dedicated section to explain but I want this to focus on how it all feel connected to me, and tt all start from this:

![riddle-me-this](img/the-riddlers.png)

This text touches on the two factions in the Path of Enigmata, and the focus here, The Riddlers, introduces me to the aspect of a language that I've been oblivious to, the **certainty** aspect of it and how it can be tampered.

That has a tie in to the discussion I had with my friend about LLM the day before. We were discussing that there might be a whole class of information that never has any textual form anywhere which LLM could probably miss, and knowing that, there ought to be something that LLM can't approximate. It was just a light discussion and we were just throwing ideas around. But now, being made aware that the language itself can have varying degrees of certainty, I saw that discussion we had in a different light.

Another tie in that I felt is about another discussion I had about writing stories. That discussion led me into thinking about how an author should structure information so that it doesn't overwhelm the reader. But I was also thinking about how much it is on the responsibility of the reader's part to understand what author has conveyed. I do not in any way have qualifications to answer all of this, but this topic of Enigmata has brought a new dimension to it, which is how an author could intentionally make something confusing in-universe with the type of confusion that *intrigues* rather than *alienates*.

Another one is about my recent realization regarding my current language skills. I felt like I have a lot of part in my understanding that is just simply an approximation rather than a definite one. I came to that conclusion because there are a lot of words that, at a glance, I felt like I understands them, but when I try shining a light on it, I lose all my confidence on how to use that word. This week I had realized that I misremembered the japanese word 運転見合わせ (I remembered it as 運転合わせ and wrongly used it in my email and realizing the mistake later). While writing, I almost misused the word "homage", when I should use the word "parody" (Thanks ChatGPT for the clarification!). Serendipitiously, since we are talking about timing, i just rediscovered the word "serendipity" last week because my friend used it when describing the art of Photography. Even in my own understanding, there is a lot of uncertainty and incompleteness that I am not fully aware of.

All of these discoveries and connections in this timely fashion, amused me a lot.

# the end is an enigma

The experience of writing this article, too, has been baffling to me. For a while, I wanted to start writing and there have been a lot of ideas to begin my writing journey. I wanted to talked about my experience attending *Tokyo Emacs* several weeks ago and how it gives me a lot of new perspective in life. I wanted to talk about how one define a good software engineers, which stems from another discussion I had with my friends. I wanted to talked about [my drawing][3] journey, an old hobby of mine that I recently picked up again. There is all these topics that is clear and direct, yet this confusing Enigmata is my first article that I finished writing.

My friends who observed my behaviour towards this Enigmata, too, must have been a perplexing one. I think there are several instance where in mid conversation, I clearly state "hey this conversation is nice, but my mind is currently full of Enigmata so I'll probably be less responsive". (I'm sorry for this friends :p)

And, and, this group of friend that I mentioned in the beginning, actually have some relation to the word Enigma...

All of these is so enigmatic...

It's as if...

It's as if this article is written by a real follower of Enigmata (self-proclaimed)

Thank you for being confused with me

### notes:

[^1]: I am also still not sure if the word "[Enigmata][1]" is an actual latin word and not just the derivation of the word Enigma. Maybe it's on purpose...
