Title: Hello, Quickblog! Hello, Emacs!

This is me trying to write a blog while also familiarizing myself with Emacs. I wanted to experience the emacs clojure experience but this is still an unfamiliar land for me. The other buffer keeps saying that it fails auto-save. I still don't understand how to wield babashka from here. But that won't stop me. I'll C-x C-s now so that I can finally commit a file and push with Magit. See ya!
